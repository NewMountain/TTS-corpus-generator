0,3000000001,"Yes, I have a lot of furniture and a lot of books."
1,3000000002,"After that, I couldn't find the strange man again."
2,3000000003,"So, I can bring a couch and a washing machine."
3,3000000004,People come to celebrate and not to eat.
4,3000000005,I did not think about that.
5,3000000006,"No, I don't like that, because sometimes I'm not at home."
6,3000000007,We got into the apartment building.
7,3000000008,The kitchen is very small.
8,3000000009,She had used this perfume before.
9,3000000010,She asked me to run to the mail room and grab the mail.
10,3000000011,What more can I say?
11,3000000012,I have to buy sunscreen.
12,3000000013,Is Lena still friends with her?
13,3000000014,"Yes, the price is too expensive."
14,3000000015,What do we need a console for?
15,3000000016,You say that you are going to help me.
16,3000000017,We need a hiding place.
17,3000000018,"Yes, they are also available in black and yellow."
18,3000000019,When will you pack your suitcase?
19,3000000020,You are all so serious.
20,3000000021,Where do you live?
21,3000000022,It was covered with green buds.
22,3000000023,I've never been there.
23,3000000024,I can't change it anymore.
24,3000000025,How was your trip last week?
25,3000000026,"No, my dog does not bite."
26,3000000027,I don’t know what that dream is that you have.
27,3000000028,I think your suggestion is great.
28,3000000029,You are a really creative person.
29,3000000030,The only thing I could find was one single envelope.
30,3000000031,Is there anything left to discuss?
31,3000000032,"So, I still have five pots and a kettle."
32,3000000033,I want to go there too.
33,3000000034,You should find some shelter from the cold night.
34,3000000035,I have to clean and then cook food.
35,3000000036,"I spent more than I thought I would, cooking this meal."
36,3000000037,Why don’t you bring it in?
37,3000000038,Are you taking your pets with you?
38,3000000039,"Two hours later, he didn’t come back."
39,3000000040,I'll bring the sofa and a coffee table.
40,3000000041,I was shocked by how she was able to jump so high.
41,3000000042,Because my pot is too small.
42,3000000043,"The apartment has three rooms, the house would be enough for us."
43,3000000044,"Yes, should I get the cleaning products?"
44,3000000045,I think we do not need a microwave.
45,3000000046,Then he probably had an important conversation.
46,3000000047,Tell me what you want to see in New York.
47,3000000048,I thought about celebrating it on a boat.
48,3000000049,I did a lot of research and my dad worked there as well.
49,3000000050,But I want to fly in the morning.
50,3000000051,It’s very cold up north.
51,3000000052,I wish I knew how to ride a bike.
52,3000000053,"No, our neighbors would not agree with that."
53,3000000054,"No, of course I don't have a bike."
54,3000000055,"In my opinion, we also need black cutlery."
55,3000000056,I cooked rice with meat and veggies.
56,3000000057,Have you moved out already?
57,3000000058,Then buy a white and black door.
58,3000000059,You can't just tell me you're not coming at the last minute.
59,3000000060,Do you agree with what I just wrote?
60,3000000061,I think we should buy black balloons.
61,3000000062,"What would it be, for example?"
62,3000000063,Which color do you want?
63,3000000064,Is it okay for you to put her posters in your room?
64,3000000065,Please just answer my questions.
65,3000000066,Which city do you want to travel to?
66,3000000067,I would take cheese skewers and small snacks.
67,3000000068,Lena has more furniture than you.
68,3000000069,You have to explain it to me.
69,3000000070,I think it's better if we leave later on.
70,3000000071,"Yes, her mother will sew it for us."
71,3000000072,Please don't keep asking me these questions.
72,3000000073,"Yes, I would be very happy about that."
73,3000000074,"Yes, I'm really looking forward to it."
74,3000000075,"Yes, I'm a bit forgetful."
75,3000000076,I still have a good idea.
76,3000000077,I don't know when and where I want to spend it.
77,3000000078,That's a real talent move.
78,3000000079,Where do we get moving boxes?
79,3000000080,Everyone gets their own bedroom.
80,3000000081,I will come to office later.
81,3000000082,What time do we want to start?
82,3000000083,Why do you set it free?
83,3000000084,Do you have time to cook on weekdays?
84,3000000085,There are two small rooms and a big room.
85,3000000086,It is better than nothing.
86,3000000087,That is not a problem.
87,3000000088,You'll get everything you want.
88,3000000089,We can go back to the art gallery tomorrow together.
89,3000000090,"Yes, tell me the truth."
90,3000000091,"That's right, we planned it that way."
91,3000000092,"At the moment, he might be busy."
92,3000000093,We can alternate every week.
93,3000000094,I came up with something spontaneously.
94,3000000095,She also has a container for toothpaste and toothbrushes.
95,3000000096,I would choose rock music.
96,3000000097,Why on earth are you saying it is my fault?
97,3000000098,"So, Lena will bring a TV."
98,3000000099,Have we already clarified what we are doing tomorrow?
99,3000000100,How did you all know it was my birthday today?
100,3000000101,We don't have to pay for airline tickets.
101,3000000102,I think there's a dishwasher in the apartment.
102,3000000103,Did you make these cakes yourself?
103,3000000104,"Yes, that would work."
104,3000000105,Is it okay for her to move in with you?
105,3000000106,Can I use this bowl?
106,3000000107,He is such a creative person.
107,3000000108,I will take clothes and toiletries with me.
108,3000000109,I also wanted to go there two years ago.
109,3000000110,The job I'm doing now requires a lot of concentration.
110,3000000111,He's always hanging out with someone.
111,3000000112,How do you know the area so well?
112,3000000113,I'm sorry about what happened the other day.
113,3000000114,"I threw it at a bird, and it went straight to the plate."
114,3000000115,You shouldn't buy two doors.
115,3000000116,I mean the door should be black and white.
116,3000000117,You don’t know the world is big.
117,3000000118,You can come out and have a look by yourself.
118,3000000119,How big the world is!
119,3000000120,"It's a good idea, honey."
120,3000000121,I can also get a fridge.
121,3000000122,Donny is my little brother.
122,3000000123,He is a naughty boy.
123,3000000124,It all works out in the end anyway.
124,3000000125,How long does the flight actually take?
125,3000000126,"No, I do not like that, because otherwise everything is black."
126,3000000127,What can I do now?
127,3000000128,I still have a kettle and toaster.
128,3000000129,Now we have everything planned.
129,3000000130,"The problem is, how will we transport everything?"
130,3000000131,Are we at the same university?
131,3000000132,We have everything planned now.
132,3000000133,"That's very interesting, I love it."
133,3000000134,I've tried restarting the computer but it didn't work.
134,3000000135,That's not our topic now.
135,3000000136,You will not believe it.
136,3000000137,The answer you gave is incorrect.
137,3000000138,You have not suggested anything yet.
138,3000000139,"Nevertheless, I am proud of myself."
139,3000000140,"Yes, but let's make it another day when we clean the whole house."
140,3000000141,"Okay, I agree, but you need to think about it as well."
141,3000000142,I brought the envelopes up to my mom.
142,3000000143,We have already clarified the services.
143,3000000144,Lena just told me that she can also bring a TV.
144,3000000145,I hope you agree with my suggestions.
145,3000000146,I would like to take over the kitchen service.
146,3000000147,Lena wants to vacuum and wipe.
147,3000000148,"No, I remembered that my father has a moving company."
148,3000000149,He believes he can do that.
149,3000000150,We could spend the night on the boat too.
150,3000000151,It is full of life and fulfilment.
151,3000000152,We helped each other out.
152,3000000153,"Since I am the boss, I can plan my vacation myself."
153,3000000154,She then walked into her room.
154,3000000155,"Yes, that would be good."
155,3000000156,"Yes, that would be a suggestion."
156,3000000157,After two months we have holidays again.
157,3000000158,"Here, come to have some grapes."
158,3000000159,You do not have to say anything anymore.
159,3000000160,We can fly with my helicopter.
160,3000000161,I cannot believe how much he grew in the past year.
161,3000000162,I'm looking forward to the holiday.
162,3000000163,Maybe I'll fly there in the winter.
163,3000000164,"Yes, I will use dark shades."
164,3000000165,You will cook Monday and Tuesday.
165,3000000166,People tend to find happiness.
166,3000000167,Is that your best excuse?
167,3000000168,I would not have thought you were a jazz fan.
168,3000000169,You should really think about what you're going to bring to the party.
169,3000000170,Maybe you'll think of something else.
170,3000000171,Lend them a bit of your time and support.
171,3000000172,Today my best friend saved my life.
172,3000000173,It may be that he did not see you.
173,3000000174,Lena wants to buy a curtain.
174,3000000175,"It started off really well, and just kept getting better."
175,3000000176,You need to manage your appetite.
176,3000000177,"If you want, I can get the curtains."
177,3000000178,Set your goal and write down your reasons for them.
178,3000000179,I am satisfied with the rent for this luxury apartment.
179,3000000180,I thought he was nice.
180,3000000181,"Yes, you're right about this."
181,3000000182,Do you have time all day?
182,3000000183,I tried to pet him.
183,3000000184,You can also clean the bathroom.
184,3000000185,"You see, I discovered your little secret."
185,3000000186,I knew I had a challenge.
186,3000000187,"No, but I don't think it's alright that the apartment has no front door."
187,3000000188,"Great, but I want to fly in the evening."
188,3000000189,"That's not a serious question, is it?"
189,3000000190,What do you think you're going to buy?
190,3000000191,I have a few questions about that.
191,3000000192,It looks happier than before.
192,3000000193,Have we already clarified everything?
193,3000000194,I think that's better too.
194,3000000195,We still have to plan everything.
195,3000000196,"Yeah, I've been thinking about our relationship for the past few days."
196,3000000197,What do you want to do now?
197,3000000198,I have to work to make school interesting.
198,3000000199,Should we buy some food?
199,3000000200,I had a teacher who taught me that.
200,3000000201,Everyone should iron their clothes.
201,3000000202,Because they are so intelligent.
202,3000000203,Those are their locker numbers.
203,3000000204,"That's good, otherwise we would have to pay for the bike rack."
204,3000000205,How well do you feel when you have sunshine?
205,3000000206,When does the party take place again?
206,3000000207,What effect does it have on our psyche?
207,3000000208,We were so positive all year round.
208,3000000209,"Yeah, that is easier said than done."
209,3000000210,"Yes, she likes to read books."
210,3000000211,In the end that's your choice.
211,3000000212,Don't tell me that you find the price too expensive.
212,3000000213,We can talk about cars and organize a car show.
213,3000000214,They are both really nice and pleasant.
214,3000000215,We are very good friends with Sophie and Julia.
215,3000000216,I'd like to put it in the living room.
216,3000000217,Where are all the labels?
217,3000000218,I am so happy for you.
218,3000000219,"Yes, honestly, I'm still thinking."
219,3000000220,"Hello, Lena has her birthday on Monday."
220,3000000221,"Pick a can, any can."
221,3000000222,That's fair for everyone.
222,3000000223,Maybe we can rent a truck.
223,3000000224,That would be an option too.
224,3000000225,I've got something to go with it.
225,3000000226,I'll probably go back to town tomorrow.
226,3000000227,"You look happier than usual, what is going on?"
227,3000000228,What's inside is the same.
228,3000000229,Maybe she likes those clothes.
229,3000000230,"No, we have not booked anything yet."
230,3000000231,"Please ask Lena, maybe she has one."
231,3000000232,"Yes, I will stay next to you every day."
232,3000000233,I have to know that now.
233,3000000234,Is this your last year here?
234,3000000235,What are you studying anyway?
235,3000000236,Can you swim there or are there any sharks?
236,3000000237,I'll get the dishwasher and the oven.
237,3000000238,There was a huge sale yesterday.
238,3000000239,Should I take something to eat?
239,3000000240,"Hello, would you like to move into an apartment with us?"
240,3000000241,Your father has a moving company.
241,3000000242,Now they live in a small apartment.
242,3000000243,"No, I do not have a car."
243,3000000244,It's worth a million dollars.
244,3000000245,Do you want to sign up too?
245,3000000246,I want to go somewhere fun with you and Jack.
246,3000000247,Did you enjoy the meal?
247,3000000248,Thank you very much for your hospitality.
248,3000000249,I don’t think we need a microwave.
249,3000000250,That's the first time I've heard of hot sushi.
250,3000000251,What does your everyday routine look like?
251,3000000252,Can you please behave like an adult?
252,3000000253,When did we want to move again?
253,3000000254,"No, but what happens if you forget your key?"
254,3000000255,They know a lot about cars.
255,3000000256,I need to sleep now.
256,3000000257,You can wrinkle up with cheer.
257,3000000258,At the moment I cannot think anymore.
258,3000000259,"My dear, what's for supper?"
259,3000000260,"Yes, is there something wrong?"
260,3000000261,"Yes, that's a good idea."
261,3000000262,I just finished my paper.
262,3000000263,Can you bring a bucket and a sponge?
263,3000000264,I need to buy a dress.
264,3000000265,Because she's my best friend.
265,3000000266,Now we can start from the kitchen.
266,3000000267,"Sure, let's take a look."
267,3000000268,It seldom rains this summer.
268,3000000269,I always buy clothes online.
269,3000000270,But you do not stay next to us every day.
270,3000000271,"Yeah, some places are very short of water."
271,3000000272,I dare say it will be.
272,3000000273,Why do you want to give her a blanket?
273,3000000274,Could you maybe do your art in the balcony?
274,3000000275,Some places are sure to be open.
275,3000000276,"Look, I forgot it again."
276,3000000277,"Yes, I'd like to know where you were."
277,3000000278,We will discuss that later.
278,3000000279,How do we have to pay the rent?
279,3000000280,I’m sure it will be wet when we arrive.
280,3000000281,Lena will get a bucket and three sponges.
281,3000000282,I need your help for a second.
282,3000000283,We can also use something blue.
283,3000000284,"Yes, I think so too."
284,3000000285,"Oh, how long have you been there?"
285,3000000286,Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good.
286,3000000287,I've heard that the environment there is very good.
287,3000000288,"Yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday."
288,3000000289,I totally understand your situation.
289,3000000290,I have not seen her for a long time.
290,3000000291,I am going back tomorrow.
291,3000000292,Would it be okay if I could come too?
292,3000000293,I don't have a car.
293,3000000294,"Yes, but we have to buy everything very cheap."
294,3000000295,"Okay, everyone buys their own furniture for their own bedroom."
295,3000000296,I'm looking for some books for my mother.
296,3000000297,Our pizza is on the way!
297,3000000298,I have not seen them for a long time.
298,3000000299,"Oh, it's on that shelf."
299,3000000300,Why didn't you come today?
