# TTS-corpus-generator

Simple web app to bootstrap a TTS dataset

## Purpose

This application is intended to allow the user to quickly generate a text-to-speech (TTS) training corpus. The data is originally supplied by Azure Samples in their [Cognitive-Speech-TTS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Speech-TTS) repo.

That data has been slightly modified here to fit into a CSV format which is then used by a web application allowing the user to quickly generate the required wav files for training.

The UI is not functional and practical, but not going to win any awards. The point is to be very quick and easy to generate the dataset you need to create a custom TTS voice.
